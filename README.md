# Text-to-Speech-Generation-using-gTTS
📌 Project Overview

This project implements a Text-to-Speech (TTS) system using gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) to convert textual input into natural-sounding audio output. The system processes user-provided text and generates speech in MP3 format, enabling applications in accessibility, automation, and voice-enabled systems.

🎯 Objective

Convert text data into speech output

Automate audio generation from written content

Demonstrate practical implementation of speech synthesis

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python

gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech API)
